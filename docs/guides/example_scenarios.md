# Example Scenarios

In the provider's repository, the [`examples/basic` directory](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/terraform-provider-catalystcenter/tree/main/examples/basic) contains basic integrations of multiple building blocks, which show how to achieve everyday tasks.

In order to review these, it's best to:

1. Install Git.
2. Clone the provider's repository, as linked above.
3. Follow the docs contained in the specific subdirectory of the examples. Docs are in the file named README.md.
